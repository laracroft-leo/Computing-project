Because the time for the MSc project is limited, we only used the wearable IMU data from the LARa dataset, i.e., the archive “IMU data (annotated) _ MbientLab.zip”.

In addition, unlike the RealWorld dataset, which was downloaded directly via Python code, for our experiments we manually downloaded the “IMU data (annotated) _ MbientLab.zip” archive and manually uploaded it to Google Colab.
