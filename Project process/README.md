The transcript in each file was automatically generated by Microsoft Teams during the recording, so its authenticity can be guaranteed.

The weekly project process records are divided into a detailed version and a simple version: the former contains more fine-grained details, while the latter summarises the core points.

The remaining files are emails or documents that I sent to my supervisor each week to seek feedback, or materials that were returned to me after being reviewed and annotated by my supervisor.
